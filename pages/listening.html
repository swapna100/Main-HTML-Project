    <div class = "desc">
    <p>Listening to something nice is much more than just a hobby. Songs or podcasts become therapeutic even for those who 
        create it. Studies show that the brain is more active while listening to podcasts than watching television.
        Podcasts require listeners to use their imagination rather than spoon-feeding consumers with visual accompaniment.  
        I practise listening mainly to reduce stress, stimulate brain cells, increase physical performance and for  
        peaceful sleep. My favourite listening items are instrumental calm piano music, praise and worship Songs, and Podcasts.
